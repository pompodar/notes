repository interface in a Laravel application for fetching data related to articles using the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection` class. This is a common practice to abstract data access and allows you to easily switch between different data sources or implementations. Here's how you can create a repository interface for your use case:

phpCopy code

`<?php  namespace App\Articles;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;  interface SearchRepository {     /**      * Search for articles based on a query.      *      * @param string $query      * @return Collection      */     public function search(string $query): Collection; }`

In this code, we define a `SearchRepository` interface with a `search` method that takes a `$query` parameter and returns a `Collection` of articles that match the query. This interface serves as a contract that concrete repository classes must implement. You can create multiple implementations of this interface, each with its own data retrieval logic (e.g., one for fetching data from a database and another for an API).

Once you have defined the repository interface, you can create concrete classes that implement it. These classes will provide the actual implementation of the `search` method and interact with the specific data source (e.g., a database) to fetch the articles based on the search query.

1. `app/Repositories/Contracts/`: This folder is for repository interfaces. You can place your `SearchRepository.php` interface in this directory.
    
2. `app/Repositories/Eloquent/`: This folder is for repository implementations. You can create an `EloquentSearchRepository.php` class in this directory, which implements the `SearchRepository` interface. This class would contain the actual code for searching articles using Eloquent (Laravel's ORM).
